*Description

	The Missing Assignment Report Generator (the "Generator")
	takes missing assignment reports generated by Canvas 
	(an Leaning Management System by Instructure, Inc.) and 
	formats it for printing. Reports are sorted by student
	and missing assignments are sorted by due date for each
	student. The Generator can also make a report using an 
	export from the Canvas gradebook.

*Installation

	Unzip "Missing_Assignment_Generator.xlsm" into the desired directory.

*Usage

	-Generating a Report:
		1) Use Canvas to generate a missing assignment report
			or start an export from the gradebook.
				NewAnalytics >> Missing Assignment Report
				Grades >> Actions >> Export
		2) Save the file as a ".CSV" file (default) in an 
			accessible location.
		3) Open the Generator (Missing_Assignment_Generator.xlsm)
		4) If prompted, enable content for this file.
		5) Click "Import from Missing Assignment Report" or
			"Import from Grade Book" and select the file from
			step 1.
			Note: If using the grade export, the Generator will include any assignments
				with a 0 or no grade. These can be deleted after the Generator
				formats the report.
		6) Ensure that the report has the correct information.
		7) Use Excel's "Print" feature to print the report.
		
	If using the missing assignment report generated by Canvas,
		the Generator displays assignments that are due on or after 
		the start date of the current quarter.

	-To Change the Start Date of the Current Quarter
		1) In the Generator, go to the sheet titled 
			"Quarter Start Date".
		2) Enter the first day of the quarter (or semester)
			into the green cell. The Generator will not 
			allow a future date for this field.
